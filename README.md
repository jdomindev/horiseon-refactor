# Horiseon Refactor

## Description

- The motivation behind this project was to refactor the code to allow for enhanced accessibility and to consolidate the css to make the code neater.
- This project was built because enhancing accessibility is important to ensure all users have the ability to access the website allowing us to reach more users.
- This refactor solves the problem of certain users not being able to get the full value out of the website.
- From this project I learned how to refactor code to ensure it is easily accessible by many users, and I learned how to consolidate css and use semantic html elements to create drier code. This makes it easier for anyone needing to work on the website.
